Bugs that we are aware of

Mobile issues:
Our previous working project was able to be played on mobile. 
With the recent changes, the computational challenges of 
the AI tree search make this process slow. In addition to this,
the board piece placement does not work (piece just hovers).

AI defense:
Tree based AIs have at times demonstrated a hesitancy to prevent winning
moves at times. The tree based search should very readily deduce that this is a strong
move for the opponent, and make an attempt to counter it.

AI immediate win:
Tree based AIs have at times hesitated to secure a win immediatly. This is likely caused
by it deducing that two paths in the decision tree produce a guaranteed win, and thus they
are given the same score weight. A more realistic AI would immediatly secure the win.
